## 📚 About This Project

This is a learning project where I practiced core JavaScript (ES6+) by building an interactive, multi-section landing page with features like tab navigation, modal popups, form submission, a countdown timer, and dynamic menu cards.

The project helped reinforce key front-end development concepts, such as DOM manipulation, asynchronous requests (AJAX), and working with form data.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To practice and deepen my understanding of modern JavaScript by building real, interactive features without using front-end frameworks.

## 🚀 Features

- Tabbed content sections
- Modal window with open/close events
- Countdown timer to a set deadline
- Dynamic rendering of cards using JavaScript classes
- Form submission with XMLHttpRequest
- Responsive layout using CSS and media queries

## 📦 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Cloudflare Workers (used for handling form submissions)

## 🛠 How to Run Locally

Simply open `index.html` in your browser.  
For form submission to work, configure the API endpoint used in `script.js`.
